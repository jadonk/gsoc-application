Hi!!
I am Naveen Saini from India and would like to work on sonic anemometer on beagleboard,picking up from last year and make it able to measure wind speed with help of 3 axis analysis.

Here I have compiled helloworld file with linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf, which was present in toolchain compiled already for macOS and got it from here http://www.welzels.de/blog/en/arm-cross-compiling-with-mac-os-x/.

thanks!
